## **üåç Background**
- E-commerce is a booming industry with vast amounts of data generated daily. To stay competitive, businesses need to understand customer behavior, optimize inventory, and drive revenue growth. This project leverages a dataset representing an online retail store üõçÔ∏è to address these challenges.

## **üõ† Tools I Used**
For my deep dive into the E-commerce Analytics, I harnessed the power of several tools:
- **üõ¢Ô∏è SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

- **Postgresql:** The choosen database management system, ideal for handling the E-commerce data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for advanced data visualizations(Matplotlib, seaborn, pandas)
- **Git & Github:** Essential for version control and sharing my scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking

- **üìä Excel:** For quick data exploration.

- **Chatgpt:** Used for repetitive tasks

## **The Analysis üîç**
Each query in this project aimed at analyzing key aspects of the online retail store's data and addressing critical questions related to the challenges faced by e-commerce businesses.
Here's my approach:

### **Customer Segmentation**

### 1. Customers who made the most orders
To identify the customers with the highest number of orders. I limited the results to the top 10 customers. 
This query highlights the customers with the most orders.

```sql
WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        Order_ID, Customer_Name
    FROM orders
    JOIN Details 
    ON orders.Order_ID = Details.Order_ID
)
SELECT 
    DISTINCT(Customer_Name) AS Customer_Name, 
    COUNT(Order_ID) AS total_order
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY total_order DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
![Customers_with_most_orders_chart_2.png](assets/Customers_with_most_orders_chart_2.png)

*This visualization is an horizontal bar chart displaying the  top 10 customers with the highest orders. this chart was generated with python*

**Insight**:
- This analysis highlights that while a few customers (e.g., Abhishek and Priyanka) have exceptionally high orders, a significant number of customers place orders closer to the average, with a cluster around 13‚Äì14 orders.


### 2. Customers who spent the most amount of money
To identify the customers with the highest amount of money spent. I limited the results to the top 10 customers. 
This query highlights the customers with the most amount of money spent.

```sql
WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        Customer_Name, Amount 
	FROM Orders
	JOIN Details 
	ON orders.Order_ID = Details.Order_ID
)
SELECT 
    DISTINCT(Customer_Name) as Customer_Name,
    SUM(Amount) as total_amount_spent
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY total_amount_spent desc
LIMIT 10;
```
| **Customer_Name** | **Total_amount_spent** |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Harivansh                    | 9902                       |
|Madhav                    | 9365                      |
| Madan Mohan                    | 7766                       |
| Shiva                   | 6339                       |
| Vishakha                   | 6120                       |
| Vrinda                   | 5820                      |
| Lalita                   | 5809                       |
*Highlighted result from the query*

### **Key Insights:**
 -
    **Top Spenders:**
        Harivansh spent the most, with ‚Çπ9,902, closely followed by Madhav at ‚Çπ9,365.

    **Spending Clusters:**
        Most customers fall between ‚Çπ6,000 and ‚Çπ7,000, with only two spending above ‚Çπ9,000.

    **Significant Gap:**
        There‚Äôs a noticeable gap of above ‚Çπ5,000 between the highest spender (Harivansh) and the lowest spenders.

### 3. Most used Payment mode
To identify the most used Payment mode. 
This query highlights the most used payment mode.

```sql
WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        Order_ID, Payment_Mode
	FROM Orders
	JOIN Details 
	ON orders.Order_ID = Details.Order_ID
)
SELECT
    Payment_Mode, 
    count(Order_ID) as "Total times used for payment"  
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY Payment_Mode
ORDER BY "Total times used for payment" desc
```
![Most_used_payment_method.PNG](assets/Most_used_payment_method.PNG)

*A bubble chart displaying the most used payment modes. Each bubble represents a specific payment method, and its size correlates with the popularity or usage level of that payment mode.*

**Insights:**

#### Breakdown:
-
    COD (Cash on Delivery):
        The largest bubble in the chart, indicating it is the most preferred or used payment method among users.

-   UPI (Unified Payments Interface):
        The second-largest bubble, showing high adoption and popularity among users for seamless digital payments.

 -   Credit Card:
        Slightly smaller than UPI, indicating that a significant number of users also rely on credit cards for transactions.

 -   Debit Card:
        Smaller than credit card usage but still relevant as a preferred payment option.

  -  EMI (Equated Monthly Installments):
        The smallest bubble among the options, indicating that EMI is the least commonly used payment mode compared to others.

### Analysis:

 -   **Popularity of COD:**
        The dominance of COD may suggest user preference for cash transactions due to trust issues with online payments or lack of access to digital payment methods.
    

 -   **Rise of UPI:**
        The large bubble for UPI highlights the growing adoption of digital wallets and real-time bank-to-bank transfer systems by customers.
    
  -  **Credit vs Debit Cards:**
        Credit card usage appears higher than debit cards, which may reflect consumer preference for rewards, offers, or the ability to defer payments.
        Debit cards, while widely available, may not provide the same incentives or credit flexibility, leading to comparatively lesser use by customers.

  -  **EMI's Smaller Share:**
        EMI being the smallest bubble could indicate that customers prefer to pay upfront rather than opt for installment-based plans, possibly due to the interest rates or limited availability of EMI options.

### 4. Average Quantity Ordered by Customers 
To identify the average quantity of products ordered by customers. 
This query highlights the average quantity of products ordered by customers.
```sql
 WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT

            Had the lowest orders across all quarters.
            Orders were relatively stable but showed a slight improvement from Qtr 3 (53 orders) to Qtr 4 (55 orders).

  -  **Seasonal Trends:**

      -  Qtr 1 consistently performs better across all categories, indicating potential seasonal factors driving higher demand (e.g., new year sales or seasonal promotions).
        Qtr 3 represents a low point across categories, suggesting a possible lull in demand during this period.

## **üìö What I Learned**
### **Tools:** 
- Throughout this project, I honed my expertise in advanced SQL techniques, including table merging, WITH clauses, CTEs, aggregate functions, CASE statements, etc, enabling me to write more efficient and complex queries.  

- This project enhanced my real-world problem-solving skills by applying SQL to address challenges faced by e-commerce businesses. I transformed curiosity and challenges into actionable insights through well-crafted SQL queries.
### **Customer Insights** 
- #### During this project, I learned how to segment customers effectively to target marketing strategies and improve sales.

### **Revenue Patterns** 
- #### I learned to Understand seasonal trends and identify high-performing products.

### **Inventory Optimization**
- #### I learned the Importance of balancing stock levels to meet demand without overstocking.

## **üí° Recommendations**
### **Payment Mode**
- COD processes should be optimized as it remains the most dominant payment mode.
- Investing in promoting digital payments,
 especially UPI, will help to reduce dependency on COD and lower operational risks related to cash handling.

### **customer purchase frequency**
**Targeted Promotions:**
- Focusing on low-activity months like June and September will boost engagement.

-    Encouraging customers like Aakanksha and Aayushi to make more frequent purchases through discounts or personalized offers will increase retention.

 **Engage Top Customers:**
  -  Rewarding active customers like Aarushi and Aayush will maintain their loyalty and increase their spending.

**Seasonal Analysis:**
- Further investigations can be made to determine if seasonal trends (e.g., holidays, sales events) drive the high numbers in months like March and November.

 **Customer Retention Strategy:**
- Using loyalty programs or subscription models will convert less consistent customers into regular buyers.

### **Revenue generation**

**Investment and Focus:**
 - marketing, supply chain optimization, and product development should be focused on top-performing categories like Saree, Printers, and Bookcases to maximize ROI.

**Performance Improvement:**
- For low-performing products, customer feedback should be analyzed, pricing strategies should be adjusted, or offerings should be repositioned to enhance visibility and sales.

- For top-performing products, market research should be conducted to replicate their success factors across other categories.

**Diversification:**
- To mitigate risk, mid-tier product categories like Phones and Stole should be strengthened for more balanced revenue streams.

### **Inventory Management:**
- Inventory risks should be reduced for low-demand items and reinvested in best-sellers.

### **Promotional Campaigns:**
- Awareness should be raised for underperforming but high-potential products (e.g., Kurti, Leggings)

- Advertising efforts should be increased during peak sales periods.
